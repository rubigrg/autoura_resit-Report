<h1>Background:</h1>
Autoura is an autonomous vehicle sightseeing and experiences via foot, bicycles, electric scooters and other modes of transport <a href="https://www.autoura.com/docs/api">(Autoura, 2019)</a>. It has ‘things to do’, which are called ‘Stops & Routes’, and include the top 6 level stop types. They are food, hotel & accommodation, point/place of interest, attraction and ticket & event <a href="https://github.com/joeappleton18/autora-api-vue-demo">(Github, 2019)</a>. These stops are base unit which are bookable and can be something to visit like point of interest (POI). However, the problem of this project is that Autoura doesn’t exist, yet. Due to this problem, an external business/consultant has provided data to create something that doesn’t exist. This is a solution to this problem, which is called a design focused that can help to design a Single Page Application for Autoura using the data provided. API must also be consumed on this design focus including processed and displayed in a user centric innovative way <a href="https://web-design-for-industry.firebaseapp.com/live_brief.pdf">(SOL, Assessment Brief, 2019)</a>.
The design focused solution will involve creating an in-depth high-fidelity mock-up using Sketch software and Mockplus software for a wireframe. In order to create Autoura SPA, there are another two vital implementations that are required and they are design patterns and user experience. The most important part of this project report is the user testing. It is crucial to receive feedback on the SPA design to ensure that there are no errors on this SPA.
   
 <h1>Methods</h1>
Primary survey was first undertaken before moving on to secondary research. The survey was crucial for the creation of Autoura SPA as the feedback contributed a lot on the design focused. The survey (will be elaborated more on the implementation section) was also done to ensure that the relevant information has been gathered to design the SPA consuming all the appropriate code, software and coding languages. 
<br>
<br>
Secondary research consisted of Codepen.io and W3schools websites; they were used as references for the SPA creation. These sources helped to find the applicable JavaScript programming language as well as helped to understand and test them before implementing them on the final product. This SPA used onclick functions, various HTML tags, elements and attributes to ensure they function the desired way.
Wireframe.cc website has been used to create the SPA's layout and structure due to it's ease of use as well as allow designers to create simeple wireframes of both websites and mobile apps. This online tool offers options that pop up when designer need them and stay hidden when they don't (Wireframe.cc, 2019).

<br>
<br>
Google forms was used to create the initial survey and a group of people were requested to fill in the survey. The aim of the survey was to collect data to understand what features and function would users like see on a website. This was to recognise how they would define a good website. These features and functions have been considered and implemented on the SPA as well as to ensure that API data has been used. It has also been ensured that every design component reload on a single page. Lastly, Brackets software has been used to code the one site app from scratch using HTML and JavaScript languages. 
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, another primary survey has been conducted in regard to the final SPA. Different participants have been requested to give feedback to confirm that the data gathered from the initial survey have been met and that the webpage reload on the same page.
The SPA website has used HTML tags, Angular Routing and JavaScript skills to ensure the page reloads on the same page, rather than loading on to a new page. This SPA design will then be uploaded on a Github repository to ensure that the product is always backed up and allow anyone to check the SPA design.



<h1> Implementation:</h1>
In regard to the design focused, secondary research included Codepen and W3schools websites. They have been used to ensure that good design inspirations and patterns has been looked at. A high-fidelity mock-up and a wireframe also have been produced and has been properly observed for better design results.
3.1 User Research
In order to design the final product, a primary survey has been conducted by requesting a group of people to participate to collect data on what colour scheme, features, fonts and the type of navigation bar they would expect to be used or on a website (figure ? below). These results, then was used to create the Autoura SPA by implementing the features, layout and colour scheme.
  
  The figure below has shown that five people have completed the survey and data on colour scheme, features, fonts and the type of navigation have been collected. It also shows that these features and functions are what they would like to see on a website. These results have been implemented on the SPA.
This feedback results were vital to this project as they have suggested that using simple and consistence colours would make the website look visibly good along with simplistic fonts. Further research on colour scheme was also looked at to ensure that an appropriate colour has been used as well as matches the aims of the website. Therefore, colour blue was chosen for the website back with white and yellow texts because it represents trust, loyalty and confidence and as the website allow users to book visits, sightseeing and more, hence, this colour is perfect as it is vital for users to feel confident and trust the site especially when accessing and booking stops & routes. More importantly, the data helped to avoid using bright colours for users with colour blindness. With a thorough research and data collated from the survey, simple menu bars have been placed on top of the page for ease of use and to give a quick access.
Due to a realistic and different demographic, questions for this survey was carefully and thoughtfully prepared because it involved people from different ethnicity, age ranged from 18 to 27 and mainly for people who were not aware of Single Page Application. Therefore, a brief definition was explained to those who didn’t know about SPA in order to gather data.

<h2> 3.2 Wireframe</h2>
Wireframe is a vital part of the design process as it will help to follow and create the product with ease. Therefore, Wireframe.cc website has been used to design the website’s layout and structure. Due to its ease of use and speed, it was done on time. The wireframe was created carefully to avoid re-design and to stop wasting time.

  <h2> 3.3 Responsive</h2>
Responsiveness is important on every website; therefore, the design of the SPA has ensured that it is responsive. It is to confirm that users can use this application on different platforms and devices.

<h1> Evaluation:</h1>
Below are the figures of the website feedback given by the group of people who were requested to test the Autoura SPA.
  This was the final survey to receive feedback of the website design and features which were implemented using the first survey as well as to confirm whether the main aims have been met or not. Six people participated on filling in this survey and as it was done by different demographic, it shows that one out of six people, one wasn’t aware of what SPA was, therefore, the answer wasn’t helpful but also, gained a valuable information at a time. However, the rest were able to recognise the difference between reload and load. Since the majority said yes, it proved that the webpage reloaded when booking a visit.
 The figure above has asked the participants if the search results reloaded on the same page and majority of them agreed beside one person. This shows that this one particular person was confused and therefore, was unable to understand the word ‘reload’. It also verifies that people who are not aware of what SPA means thought that ‘reload’ and ‘load’ are the same.

   Participants have agreed that navigation bar are easy to use and that the colour scheme was appropriate and suitable for the website which matches with the data collated from the previous survey. However, couple of them have stated that even though the colour used for this website, they thought bright or fresh colours would have been a better colour as they match with the sightseeing, attraction and such as they are fun and vacations purpose.
The users agreed that the website have used appropriate fonts and that they are readable too which matches the collected data from the survey.
 
  <h1>Reflection:</h1>
This unit was interesting and fun to learn new advanced skills. However, it was difficult to learn and understand this unit due to less time and tons of assignment from different units. When starting this project report, I struggled a lot with Vue.js, Angular.js and many more due to lack of coding knowledge. They weren’t taught before, therefore, it was too much for me to this year to make websites using them. I had no experience using them; hence, I watched many tutorial videos to understand and grasp how they can be used on this project. There were a lot of researching that included how SPA work and how to create a SPA websites or apps.
Before starting this project, I practiced using icloud9 and the terminal as they were very hard to understand and use. Terminal was used to upload the file on my Github repository; however, I failed to do and came across with any errors, which lead me to plan again what focus would be easier for me to create the final product. Due to these difficulties with the development, I decided to do the design focused for this project, which I have no problem doing this. In order to do the SPA design, I ensure that I did enough research to understand and recognise what I need to do to design the SPA and how I can make it better.
Overall, the unit taught me a lot about the development area as I lack the skills for it. In the end, I still struggled with this project and managed to design the single page application for Autoura. This is not enough skills for me to go on to web developer field. This is something I will have to keep learning and practicing every day in order to become a professional web developer in the future. On the other hand, this unit helped me gain many new skills such as more advanced JavaScript and modern technologies.
